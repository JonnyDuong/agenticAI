2.2.3
Length penalty

Following [Yu et al., 2025], we use soft length penalty to signal the model that the hard cutoff on
maximal completion length is near. We fix two lengths lmax and lcache and compute length penalty as





0,
|y| ≤lmax −lcache
−0.1 · |y|−lmax+lcache

Rlength(y) =

lcache
,
lmax −lcache < |y| ≤lmax,
−0.1,
lmax < |y|
(1)



