Code

We gathered code contest data from various sources. Each data point includes a problem statement
and, when available, correct solutions and related tests. For the training process, we want problem
statements and a large number of correct tests per problem. In order to achieve this, we first remove
any problems without solutions and without enough tests. Each solution is then executed on all
available tests, and we discard tests with insufficient agreement. For tests with sufficient agreement
but where no solution succeeded, we assume that the test is incorrect and update it to reflect the most
common result among the solutionsâ€™ outputs. In cases where code problems lack tests, we generate
additional tests and subject them to the same evaluation process.

Finally, where applicable, problem statements are duplicated to require code in Python or C++, two
commonly used languages in competitive programming. This process resulted in a dataset of 35k
code problems.
