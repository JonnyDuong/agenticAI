6.1
Cross-domain generalization

We investigate the ability of our model to generalize across domains by training on one domain (math
or code) and evaluating on the other. Specifically, we conduct two experiments on the 24B model:
one where the model is trained exclusively on math data and evaluated on both math and code, and
another where it is trained only on code and evaluated similarly. As shown in Table 5, the model
demonstrates strong performance to out-of-domain tasks, showcasing the generalization ability of RL.
