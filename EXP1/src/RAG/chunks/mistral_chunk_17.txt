Experiment and results

In this section we present the Magistral models. Our goal is to answer two questions: (i) how far can
one get with pure reinforcement learning on a large base model? (ii) given a strong teacher model,
how can one achieve the strongest possible lightweight model? To this end, we trained Magistral
Medium, on top of Mistral Medium 3 [MistralAI, 2025] with pure RL; and Magistral Small, which
began with SFT traces derived from Magistral Medium.

Figure 4: Overview of the filtering, training and RL stages discussed in the paper. We do RL over
Mistral Medium 3 to get Magistral Medium. We use this model to generate answers for a large set of diverse
prompts. We use these generated traces to finetune Mistral Small 3 and then perform RL to get Magistral Small.
