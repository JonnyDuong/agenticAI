Methodology

In this section, we outline the training methodology used to develop the Magistral models. This
includes our optimizations of the GRPO algorithm for training stability (Section 2.1) and our training
reward to improve both mathematical and coding capabilities, while ensuring the model adheres to
proper format, length, and language usage (Section 2.2).
