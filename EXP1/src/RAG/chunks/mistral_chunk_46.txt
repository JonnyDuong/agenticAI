7.3
Impact of RL on other capabilities

Similar to the multimodal capabilities mentioned in Section 7.2, our RL checkpoint maintains and
even improves its tool calling and instruction following capabilities [Zhou et al., 2023] (Table 6).
This allows us to integrate the model out-of-the-box with existing tools as shown.

Table 6: Benchmarks before and after reinforcement learning. Internal bench is Mistralâ€™s internal function
calling benchmark. We use an internal version of IFEval that fixes some issues with the public version. The
scores are not comparable with other publicly shared scores.
