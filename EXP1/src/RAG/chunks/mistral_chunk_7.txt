2.2.1
Formatting

For both math and code problems, we instruct the model to follow a specific format, which facilitates
the extraction of the modelâ€™s answer:

1. Tag requirements: (i) The model response must start with a <think> tag and must include
a corresponding </think> tag. (ii) There should be exactly one set of these tags present in
the response.

2. Mathematical responses: For mathematical outputs, the response must include the final
answer enclosed in \boxed{} within the answer section, following the </think> tag.

3. Code responses: For code outputs, the response must include at least one markdown block,
formatted with triple backticks followed by the programming language specification, in the
answer section.

Failure to meet any of these conditions results in a reward of 0, and the response will not be graded
further. Otherwise, the response gets a reward of 0.1 and proceeds to grading.
